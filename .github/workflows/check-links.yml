          # Notes:
          # - The `>` symbol tells the YAML parser to replace newlines with whitespace. This way, we don't
          #   have to terminate each line with a `\` character to escape the invisible newline character.
          # - The `--format` option refers to the format of the report, not the documents being scanned.
          # - The `--exclude-loopback` option makes it so Lychee does not check "localhost" URLs.
          # - The `--exclude <PATTERN>` option can be used multiple times.

          # Exclusion notes:
          # - We exclude Rancher URLs (i.e. `https://rancher2.spin.nersc.gov`) because GHA cannot access any of
          #   them besides the Rancher login page.
          # - We exclude the NMDC Instagram page's URL (i.e. `https://www.instagram.com/microbiomedata`) because,
          #   when we don't, our broken link report contains "HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests" errors for that URL.
