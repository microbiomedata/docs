### NMDC Submission Portal
The NMDC Submission Portal provides an interface for capturing information about their study, biosample metadata, and multi-omics data generated from the biosamples. For Department of Energy (DOE) researchers, we support data and analysis outputs generated at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL). Updates and new features are continually being implemented as user research provides new insights to improve usability, and as standards are updated and improved. 

All submissions to NMDC are kept private and adhere to DOE's data embargo, aligning with user facility data release policies. Submissions are reviewed and once approved the submission will be held until ready for release.
