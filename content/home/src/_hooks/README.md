# _hooks

This directory contains custom MkDocs [hooks](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#hooks).

The underscore in the directory name was added only to make it resemble the existing `_static` and `_templates` directories, which contain stuff other than page content. The underscore is not _technically_ necessary.
